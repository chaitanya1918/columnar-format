# Custom Columnar File Format (CCF) Project

This project implements a simple custom binary **columnar file format** in Python.

It contains:

- A formal binary format specification (`SPEC.md`)
- A writer program (`writer.py`) that creates `.ccf` files
- A reader program (`reader.py`) that reads `.ccf` files
- A sample binary file (`example.ccf`)
- A sample CSV file (`sample.csv`) for testing
- A `screenshots/` folder (optional) showing execution proof

## 1. Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design and implement a custom binary columnar format.  
The format is called **CCF (Custom Columnar Format)** and is documented in `SPEC.md`.

Each file stores:

- Magic bytes (`CCF1`) and a version number
- A header with number of columns and rows
- Per-column metadata (type, name, data offset)
- Column data stored in binary form

## 2. Files in This Project

- `SPEC.md` – Detailed description of the binary file layout.
- `writer.py` – Python script that writes `example.ccf`.
- `reader.py` – Python script that reads `example.ccf`.
- `example.ccf` – Sample binary file generated by `writer.py`.
- `sample.csv` – Simple CSV file for testing (age and salary).
- `README.md` – This documentation file.
- `screenshots/` – (Optional) contains screenshots of the program running.
